 * \defgroup crlibm crlibm functions access
 * \brief Allows easy access crlibm functions from nt2,
 * i.e functions from the corectly
 * rounded mathematical library.
 *
 * These functions are very accurate but can be slow.
 * These are proposed here, mainly for tests and comparison and if
 * you need maximum precision on computations.
 * \par
 * In most usual cases, using nt2 proper function implementation
 * of corresponding functions will make you loose 1 ulp or less.
