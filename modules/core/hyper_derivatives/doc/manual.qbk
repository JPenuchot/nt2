[library Hyperbolic Derivatives Functions
  [quickbook 1.5]
]

[section Overview]
This module provides implementation of derivatives of functions
present in the hyperbolic toolbox

This mean for each functor of the hyperbolic toolbox ??? of one floting variable
a functor d_???

The derivative is only valid at ordinary points, meaning point where the original
function is actually derivable. It works for real and complex arguments
