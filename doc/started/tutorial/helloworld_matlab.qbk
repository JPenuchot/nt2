[section A Matlab to __NT2__ Introduction]
This section will take a sample Matlab code and turn it into its __NT2__ counterpart.
Each steps will try to enforce how __NT2__ and Matlab code relate to each other,
highlighting both similarities and differences.

Here's our Matlab sample

[teletype]
``
y = reshape( 1:16, 4, 4 );
x = sqrt( sin(y).^2 + cos(y).^2 )
``

Nothing very fancy, we compute a =4x4= matrix full of =1= in maybe the most
inefficient way.
