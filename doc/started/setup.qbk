[def __NT2__ *NT2* ]

[section Overview]
This chapter will guide you through the necessary step to download, configure
and install __NT2__ on your system. We take for granted that you have the basic
knowledge in C++ and usual system related operations.

[heading Software Requirements]

* [@http://www.boost.org *Boost*]: __NT2__ depends on the
  [@http://www.boost.org Boost Library] for its internal implementation.
  Version 1.49 or superior is required. Consult the
  [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/more/getting_started/index.html Boost Getting Started page]
  for information on how to set up and use [@http://www.boost.org Boost].

* [@http://git-scm.com *Git*]: If you wish to grab latest __NT2__ updates from our
  [@https://github.com/MetaScale/nt2 Github repository], you will need a copy
  of [@http://git-scm.com Git] installed. Consult the
  [@http://progit.org/book Pro Git book] for information on how to set up and
  use [@http://git-scm.com Git].

* *__CMAKE__*: __NT2__ is built through the meta-build
  system __CMAKE__. Version 2.8.8 or superior is required and
  can be [@http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html downloaded here].
  See the [@http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake CMake Wiki] for information on how
  to set up and use __CMAKE__.

* If you intent to build this documentation locally, you'll need a copy of
  [@http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ Doxygen], the
  [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/boostbook.html Boostbook toolchain]
  and [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/quickbook.html Quickbook].

Some other modules may have other external dependencies. Those are listed in
said module documentation and are only required if you plan to use such a module.

[heading Supported Architectures and Compilers]
__NT2__ currently is supported by the following compilers:

* [@http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] version 4.2.1 or superior on any systems.
* *Microsoft Visual Studio* version 10 or superior. Profesionnal version is
  required to access [@http://openmp.org/wp/ OpenMP] support.
* [@http://clang.llvm.org/ Clang] version 2.9 or superior.
* [@http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/ Intel C/C++ Compiler]
  version 9.0 or superior.

Other compilers may support __NT2__ code base. Reports and experiment are welcome
but keep in mind __NT2__ push the compiler really hard.

Supported architecture include:

* [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD#Hardware SIMD Extensions]:
 * SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4 and AVX on x86 and AMD processors.
 * Altivec on PowerPC processors.
* Multicore processors through [@http://openmp.org/wp/ OpenMP] 2.0 compliant
  compilers.
