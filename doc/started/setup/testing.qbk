[section Testing __NT2__]

__NT2__ provides a large array of Unit Tests covering all its functionalities.
Those tests can be run locally by using CTest either globally or by using
CTest finer-grain test selection using regular expressions to select a module or
a single function to test.

[heading Type of Tests]
__NT2__ provides three types of tests:

* Regular Unit Tests that assert the correctness of both compilation and execution
of __NT2__ under a given set of platform, architecture and compiler.
* Cover Tests that provide a random sampling tests of precision for numerical
algorithms. Those cover help __NT2__ developer to maintain a high level of
numerical precision.
* Exhaustive Tests that performs an exhaustive exploration of a function value
space to assess numerical precision. Those cover usually are only provided for
single precision reals for time constraints. There output is an histogram
