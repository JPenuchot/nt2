[section Elementwise functions]

In fact elementwise functions are the most numerous. We provide around xxx of them.
They are current functions that are perfectly well defined on scalars and the result of their
action on a matrix is the same as the undordered action of the correspoding scalar function
on each of its elements

As they are the most numerous we will further split them according their range of application:
