[section Elementary Arrays]

Globally the uses and syntaxes are quite identical, functions as `ones`, `eye` or 
`zeros` can have as in Matlab a last parameter precising the ouput type of element (that 
by default is double) the syntax are for instance:

# `ones(...,'single')` in Matlab
# `ones(...,as_<float>())` in __NT2__ (note that `as_` is in namespace `nt2::meta`)

functions as freqspace can return several results, in __NT2__ too... The respective syntaxes are:

# `[a,b] = freqspace(...)` in Matlab
# `tie(a,b) = freqspace(...)` in Nt2 (note that `tie_` is in namespace `nt2`)
