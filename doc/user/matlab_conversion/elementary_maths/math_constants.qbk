[section Mathematical constants]

Matlab has few predefined mathematical constants. __NT2__ a lot more.

We urge to use __NT2__ constants whereever possible, they all begin with an upper case character,
and need a type and are called as nullary template functions.

In the following table `T` is the current data type and the __MATLAB__ defult corresponds to `double`.
