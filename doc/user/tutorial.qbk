[section Overview] 

There are principaly two kinds of people using NT2

Those who know Matlab concepts

Those coming from straight C/C++

For each kind we propose 

# A catalog of equivalence between what can be done in Matlab (respectively C/C+ and what can be used in NT2,
# A pack of do and don't in order to get better performance out of the written code.
