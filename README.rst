About **NT**:sup:`2`
--------------------
The **Numerical Template Toolbox** (**NT**:sup:`2`) is an Open Source C++ library
aimed at simplifying the development, debugging and optimization of high-performance
computing application by providing a **Matlab** like syntax that ease the transition
between prototype and actual application.

So What is This About ?
:::::::::::::::::::::::
Do you ever wanted to use your multicore machines to its fullest or to take
advantage of your processor's SIMD extension but never did because of the
impressive learning curve ? By pushing the limits of the C++ language, **NT**:sup:`2`
uses template metaprogramming to its fullest and automatize those tasks. Reaping
the reward of parallelism has never been so easy and straightforward. Performances
of **NT**:sup:`2` code is then on the par with hand-written, optimized C code while
keeping a high level of abstraction.
